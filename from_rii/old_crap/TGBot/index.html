    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p> Sidebar, right. You can put here everything you need, just write down id="sidebar" in the tagname space.</p>
    <h1>My apologies for hurting your eyes</h1>
    <p>Well, i would to make something better, but my bro deleted my project, so i had to make this for 2 hours. Don't beat me, please!</p>

    <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
    <p> Hello and welcome to "Green Line" template made by me! Well, this template uses GIF and stand out sidebar (Wow, so cool, thins of 2nd day learning html/css. Great.). I wanted to make a great thing with incredible design and posh features, but... Something went wrong, as you can see here. Well, i want you to know i made this for couple hours, so... This will be better once.</p>
    <p> A note on the slogan in the header: The gap between the grey line and the slogan is adjusted in the css. If your site title is longer than mine then you may have to adjust this value! </p>
    <h1 id="css">CSS &amp; HTML</h1>
    <p> As you would expect, this web site makes use of css for its entire layout. No nasty tables here baby! The markup is also valid HTML strict. CSS &amp; HTML are important for the following reasons: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessibility. Big subject. Read more <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Keeping file sizes small</li>
      <li>Search Engine Optimisation</li>
      <li>Loads more</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Anyway, this site validates as both <a href="#">CSS</a> and <a href="#">HTML</a> compliant. Which is nice. </p>
    <h1 id="author">About the Author</h1>
    <p> Hi, name's Pete and i'm 16 y.o. programmer. Well, not really, i'm still learning. </p>
    <h1>Some Examples</h1>
    <p> OK, here I'll just put some example html elements that you will most probably be using in your blog. </p>
    <h2>Blockquote Example</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p> Here's your blockquote text. Lorem ipsum "and so on"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>List Example</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Here</li>
      <li>Is our friend</li>
      <li>The list!</li>
      <li>Well, you know it already, but this is not a waste of time to introduce it again, it is so good.</li>
    </ul>
